## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.


## Systems Design
## Introduction

First off, we started our process by purchasing the Traxxas LaTrax Rally ⅛ 4WD RTR Rally Racer kit. Upon its arrival we took off the cover, and decided to make modifications. The first change we made was replacing the original motor with the 2435 Brushless 4500KV Motor. This ensured that our car would be powerful enough to perform in the competition. Next, we made a cover for the vehicle using cardboard and black duct tape. However, we decided that it would not be sturdy enough, so we ended up using a clipboard for holding the car’s parts and a lego camera mount. We found this to be much more stable than the previous make. After this we 

_This part must be filled by participants with the technical clarifications about the code: which modules the code consists of, how they are related to the electromechanical components of the vehicle, and what is the process to build/compile/upload the code to the vehicle’s controllers._
